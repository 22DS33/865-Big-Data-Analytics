It previously supported only PyTorch, but, as of late 2019, TensorFlow 2 is supported as well. While the library can be used for many tasks from Natural Language Inference (NLI) to Question-Answering, text classification remains one of the most popular and practical use cases.\n\nTransformers (formerly known as pytorch-transformers and pytorch-pretrained-bert) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNetâ€¦) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/transformers/"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"7401df88-47ec-4293-8327-a6092746d464","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from
