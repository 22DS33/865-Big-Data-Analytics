It previously supported only PyTorch, but, as of late 2019, TensorFlow 2 is supported as well. While the library can be used for many tasks from Natural Language Inference (NLI) to Question-Answering, text classification remains one of the most popular and practical use cases.\n\nTransformers (formerly known as pytorch-transformers and pytorch-pretrained-bert) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNetâ€¦) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between Jax, PyTorch and

DESCRIPTION\nThere are two main learning objectives of this course:\n1.\tBig Data \nIn this course, we discuss the relatively new discipline known as big data. The term big data is overloaded and simultaneously refers to the description of the data itself, the IT techniques necessary for handling massive data sets, the analytics and AI techniques that are possible with large data sets, and the business decisions/problems that we can address by leveraging the data. We will investigate all of these areas. We will also survey key IT technologies, such as enterprise data warehouses, enterprise data lakes, Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL databases, the cloud, and more. \n2.\tNatural Language Processing\nNatural Language Processing is one of the six AI disciplines. In this part of the course, we will discuss the major practice areas of NLP such as Document Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Language Generation, Chatbots, and Machine Translation. We will also discuss the relatively new concept of Transfer Learning in NLP and how it has derived the massive progress in the area of language modeling (BERT, GPT3, BART, etc.). We will also discuss EDA and preprocessing on text data in much detail as it forms the foundation of NLP. You will learn tools and techniques for handling text data, including text preprocessing and representation, extracting structure, topic modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis. \n\"\"\")"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"5a93ed64-0fec-428f-a66d-9dee06af40da","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"name":null,"datasetInfos":[],"data":"Out[3]: [{'summary_text': ' The term big data is overloaded and simultaneously refers to the description of the data itself, the IT techniques necessary for handling massive data sets, the analytics and AI techniques that are possible with large data sets .
